CHANGES for "Learning Core Audio: A Hands-On Guide to Audio Programming for Mac and iOS" sample code

January 23, 2013

CH06_AudioConverter/
	main.c
--------------------
After line 205, added
	free (outputBuffer);
to release memory that was malloc()ed on line 163.	
(thanks Matt Daugherty)

CH07_AUGraphSpeechSynthesis/
	main.c
----------------------------
After line 196, added
	DisposeAUGraph(player.graph);
to release the AUGraph.
(thanks Seth Willits)

CH08_AUGraphInput/
	main.cpp
------------------
Changed line 58 from:
	if ((player->firstOutputSampleTime > 0.0) &&
to
	if ((player->firstOutputSampleTime > -1.0) &&

Changed line 104 from:
	if ((player->firstInputSampleTime > 0.0) &&
to
	if ((player->firstInputSampleTime > -1.0) &&
to properly check against the -1 flag value that is set on these counters before they're first used (see the -1 initializations on lines 481 and 320, respectively).
(thanks Ron Lee)

CH08_AUGraphInput/
	CH08_AUGraphInput.xcodeproj
-------------------------------
The project's references to the CARingBuffer.h and CARingBuffer.cpp files now uses an absolute reference to the /Library/Developer/CoreAudio/PublicUtility folder, which is their expected location as of Xcode 4.5 and up. Search Xcode documentation for "Core Audio Utility Classes", a pseudo sample code project, for the latest version of these classes. The Readme.rtf supplied with the classes indicates that this is their new expected path (replacing /Developer/Extras/CoreAudio/PublicUtility, where they were automatically installed prior to Xcode 4.3, and where the book describes them being).


August 29, 2012:

All projects:
-------------
Now that Xcode 4.4 has dropped support for OS X 10.6 as a base SDK, we have updated all the OS X project files to build for the OS X 10.7 SDK. The deployment target is still 10.6. iOS projects are still "Latest iOS", and work on iOS 5.1, the current public version as of this writing.

CH02_CAToneFileGenerator/
		main.m
-------------------------		
Changed line 106 from:
	NSLog (@"wrote %ld samples", sampleCount);
to
	NSLog (@"wrote %ld samples", sampleCount);
to match the bit-depth of the sampleCount argument
(thanks "jarryd")


CH07_AUGraphSineWave/
		main.c
----------------------
Changed line 96 from:
	input.inputProcRefCon = &player;
to
	input.inputProcRefCon = player;
to correct the pointer type of player, and eliminate a crash when the sleep() exits.
(thanks Stefan Frauenfelder and Dmitri Kharlamov)


CH10_iOSBackgroundingTone/
		CH10_iOSBackgroundingToneAppDelegate.m
-----------------------------------------------		
Changed line 63 from:
	(data)[frame] = (SInt16) (sin (2 * M_PI * (j / cycleLength)) * 0x8000);
to
	(data)[frame] = (SInt16) (sin (2 * M_PI * (j / cycleLength)) * SHRT_MAX);
to eliminate malformed waves at certain frequencies / sample rates.
(thanks Markus Boigner)
